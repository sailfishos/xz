  <title>LZMA compression utilities</title>
  <description>XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in
freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing tools and libraries
which are similar to use than the equivalents of the most popular existing
compression algorithms.

LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov as
part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while keeping the
decompression speed fast.
